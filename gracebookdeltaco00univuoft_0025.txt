One of the provisions of this code, namely that for the election
of proctors, is mentioned in the last grace on p. 122. Extra
privileges and powers were conferred on Heads of Houses, and the
powers of the Caput were extended over the whole academie year,
instead of, as formerly, being restricted to each particular congre-
gation¹.>

It may be remarked, that an¹ attempt was made in Convocation
(J anuary, 1557-8) to revive one ancient practice, amongst others
which had been abolished under Henry VIII3 it was proposed
“that all monasteries should send some of the more apt of the
religious to Oxford or Cambridge.'’ Of course nothing came of this
proposal: the only Monastery actually revived at this time, I
believe, was that of Westminster. .

Soon after the accession of Elizabeth, November 17, 1558,
another Visitation of the University took place, with fresh revision
of the statutes The changes were not very important, the results
being substantially the same as those under the Edwardian regula-
tions. 1 presume these are the statutes mentioned in the grace of
June 27, 1562, as having been read and approved. If so, they
were soon superseded by a much more important and permanent
Oode. .

In August, 1564, occurred the famous visit of the Queen, by far
the most protracted and splendid of such functions which Cambridge
has seen. The grace decreeing, that “it maye be full terme duryng
the aboade of the Queen's Majesty here‚'' is given on p. 181. A
long list of honorary degrees follows.

In the following year, 1565, two of the last traces of the old
ways of religious thought and practice were finally destroyed. All
windows containing prayers for the dead were ordered to be removed
(p. 189), and the University cross, so recently bought, was with
other superstitious monuments again disposed of (p. 191) “for the
benefit and profit of the University.'' For the disposal of the
duties and emoluments of the chaplaincy, at its suppression in 1568,
see p. 241.

'Phe most important event, from the academical point of view,
during this reign, was the imposition of the famous Elizabethan
Statutes, which continued authoritative for almost 300 years. At
the time of the Commission, fifty years ago, these statutes naturally
