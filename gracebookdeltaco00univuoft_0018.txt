xii INTRoDUc'rmN

The Bachelor and Doctor of Divinity have remained practically
unchanged, as regards requirements and significance, with one
exception. The old expression in common use for the B.D. was
that he was admitted “ad intrandum libros Sententiarum? By
the Royal Injunctions referred to in the grace of 1543-4 (p. 17)
lectures on Peter Lombard were forbidden3 and the phrase is
generally dropped except when applied to past degrees, or during
the Marian period. The degrees in Theology were naturally much
more numerous, relatively, at a time when the great majority of
graduates took orders, and when most College statutes required that
a fellow should in due course proceed to RD.

The degrees in Oivil Law are probably about as numerous as
they were in the preceding Grace Books. As they are always
described as being Civil Law, I have indicated them by the letters
B.G.L. and D.C.L. In modern times they were commonly repre-
sented by LL.B. and LL.D., which seems to have given rise
(owing to the double letters) to a belief that the Canon Law,
though abolished in fact, was still retained in the name. From the
first the B.O.L. seems to have ranked almost, if not quite, as the
equivalent of the M.A. in Arts. It was seldom conferred till after
six or seven years of study, and men were elected to fellowships
at Trinity Hall occasionally before they had actually taken the
'degree

As to Medicine, a few words must be said. It is another sign
of Modernism that degrees in this faculty are becoming far more
common. Throughout the whole 42 years included in Grace Book
Γ, only one M.D.‚ one M.B., and eight licences to practise, are
recorded. In Δ we have a total of 124, including no less than 63
who proceeded to M.D.

In regard to the higher degree, that of Doctor, there does not
seem any difficulty. By statute (Statum antiqua, no. 90)1 the M.D.
was granted to those only who had already taken the M.A., besides
having devoted five years' study to the subject. These requirements
seem to have been adhered to fairly closely. Of the 63 M.D.'s‚ no
less than 64 were M.A. and three B.A.; three others were in-
corpomtions from foreign Universities. This leaves only three of
whom we can say, that they had not taken an Arts degree: two of
theno were already ΜΒ. and the third held the licenoe to practise.

¹ 'rho oona-ponding Elisabethan statute makes little change here, beyond
extending the time ol study to sevon years.
