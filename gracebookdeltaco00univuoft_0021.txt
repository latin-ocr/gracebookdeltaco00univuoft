and therefore became more popular. But how it was recognised in
the statute I do not see. Nor can I ascertain, whether the licence
was recognised as a “degree '' by other Universities; though the
acceptance of Mr Butler by the College of Physicians is a strong
case.

The main outlines of History, national and academie, so far as
they are illustrated in this volume, must be very briefly sketched.
We open with the final years of Hem-y VIII, after his quarrel with
the Papacy. The old religion was unchanged in essentiale, and
such a strenuous supporter of Rome as Stephen Gardiner continued
in the Ohancellorship. But Canon Law was abolished; and in
consequence of the suppression of the Monasteries one numerous
and conspicuous element, both 'in University and College life—the
monks and friars—had finally disappeared.

With the accession of Edward VI (Jan. 28, 1546-7) the first
decisive indications of the Reformation become apparent. In the
course of the year the king’s uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of
Somerset, became Ohancellor in place of Gardiner. We then see

prisoner on religious grounds, is appointed one of the University
appraisers (p. 62); Martin Bucar, the eminent reformer, is created
D.D.; J. E. Tremellius, another foreign reformor, is appointed
Hebrew professor (p. 74).

Then came the short fortnight of the unfortunate Lady J ane
Grey, the dramatic scenes of which are so closely connected with
Cambridge. Edward VI died June 6, 1553. A few days afterwards,
the Duke of Northumberland, Chaucellor of the University and
Lady -Jane's father-in-law, arrived in Cambridge, and directed the
Vico-Chaucellor, Dr SandyS, to preach on the occasion at St Mary’s
Church. Two οι· three days afterwards, just as the sermon was to

be sent up to London for publication, news came that the cause of

Lady Jane had collapsed. The Duke, who had returned from
Suffolk, and the ViceChancellor, hurried into the market-place and
proclaimed Queen Mary. Then followed the scene so graphically
described by Foxe¹. The Vice-Chancellor, who was walking in the
