The text has been printed from a transcript made by Mr A.
Rogers, of the University Library, collated with the original by

myself. For frequent help, and various suggestions, I have to thank
the kindness of Mr W. G. Searle and Dr H. P. Stokes.

The prefatory duties of successive editors of these Grace Books
grow gradually simpler and easier. To Μι- Stanley Leathes fell the
difficult task of explaining, for Book A, the methods and the
phraseology of a medieval system. The first steps in the change
towards Modernism, as illustrated in B and Γ, have been admirably
discussed by Miss M. Bateson, in the two volumes edited by her ς and
by the Rev. W. G. Searle and Mr J. W. Clark, the late Registrary,
in the volume edited by the former. In Grace Book Δ we find
ourselves, at any rate after the first few years, in what is, so far as
outward form is concerned, the Cambridge of recent times 3 that is,
Cambridge as senior members of the University can still remember
it. As this statement may seem rather strange to some of our
readers, a short explanation may be advisable.

When we talk of outward form here, we are referring to Laws
and Phraseology 3 and Laws and Phraseology, it need hardly be
said, may remain unaltered, notwithstanding very extensive changes
of interpretation and of custom. It is the old contrast between
the Letter and the Spirit. To begin with the constituent elements
of the University as a whole, namely the Colleges: here we
have essentially the modern system. Almost from the commence-
ment of this volume, 14 of the 17 Colleges, which practically
composed the University until 1860, were not merely in existence,
but were, in every sense in which identity can be predicated of such
institutione, the same as they are now. Only one, Gonville Han,
has even changed its name on its enlargement. And with this
exception, the statutes under which the Colleges were then governed
remained, Ι believe, almost unaltered until the Commission of sixty
years ago.

These Collegae, then, as for three centurias to come, practically
constituted the whole University3 and their Heads were already
acquir-ing that propenderent power in University affairs against
which the Commission of 1850 legislated. The Hostels were fast
dying out, and after 1550 they played an extremely small part in
Aemlemical life. I believe that there is not a single reference to
any one of them in the whole of this volume.
