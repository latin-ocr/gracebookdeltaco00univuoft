came in for much discussion and criticism. They are carefully
analyzed and described in Dean Peacock's Obsco-vatione, the most
important passages in which are reproduced in Cooper's Αηηαῖε.
Their general effect was greatly to increase the power of the Heads,
both in the University and in their own Colleges3 and greatly to
diminish the importance of the Caput as a reflection of the opinion
of the resident graduatae (see back, p. x). The authority of the
proctors was much curtailed, and instead of being freely elected by
the regents they were to be nominated in a cycle by the Colleges.
Stringent restrictions were imposed upon the power of the
University to grant any degrees except those allowed by the
standard regulations. It was for this reason that whenever what
came to be called an honorary degree was granted, it was generally
considered requisite to obtain ‘⁴ royal letters '' or a mandate.

The grace on p. 284 concerning the “ University street '’ refers
to the gift of Archbishop Parker. He made a new read from
opposite St Mary’s Ohurch to the Public Schools‚ removing a
number of small house-s for the purpose, “that so a more handsome
sight might be of the Public Schools’' (Strype, Parlcer, 11. 406).
The deed of gift is printed in Mr Olark’s Endowments.

One of the early intimatione of the increasing importance of the
Public Library is afforded by the grace of J uly 10‘, 1577 : ‘⁴ Maye it
please you to ratifye the stipend of xli lymited for the keper of the
librarye ” (p. 304)¹. Four years later there was a grace for exacting
contributions from all graduates towards the payment of the
librarian (p. 345). In 1586 (p. 414) reference is made to a large
prospective increase by gifts of books from genereus donors.

The ancient and stately University ceremonial as displayed in
the frequent processione-so dear to the beart of Dr Caius—had
’ presumably somewhat dropped into desuetudo, along with the
‹liscarded crass. The insistence on the due observance of “scarlct
<lays ‘' seems to indicate a reviving interest in lay oeremonial (p. 312).

In 1580 new seals were made for the University and for the

. office of Ohancellor (pp. 343, 344).

ln 1583 it appears that the increasing numbers of studente, and

the paymcnt and dutiee of the examiners (p. 360). In the same
