year by year the difl'erences will be found quite insignificant. The
subjecte of examination, for instance, were gradually changed. In
early days they were wholly what we should now call philosophical z
in course of time they became wholly mathematical. But the
change took place ahnost insensibly3 by small innovations on the
part of examiners rather than by deliberate intention on the part of
the legislatore. At first the names were arranged in one single
list: the division into “wranglers‚'' “senior optimes‚'’ and “junior
optimeS,'' was of later introduction.

But the most important transformation was one about which it
is very difficult to get definite information. At first, nothing more
seems to have been contemplated than an ‘⁴ order of seniority ” : this
remained the technical designation till quite recent times, and has,
in fact, never been abandoned. But the list subsequently claimed
to be, and was universally recognised as being, an “ order of merit.''
“Honours‚'' and all else which this implies, were determined by a
man's place in the list. Now when did this remarkable change take
place? All that I can say is that it seems to have developed during
the first half of the eighteenth century¹. It is of course nearly
certain that some notion of merit, in the sense of intellectual
superiority, must have been recognised all along3 at least so far as
the men towards the top of the list are concerned. Several con-
sideratione support this view. For instance, examinare were

¹ It is impossible here to give more than a hint at the grounds of this
opinion. It is partly based on a large number cf biographical details.
Compare, for instance, the language of two mathematicians‚ william Whiston
and Richard Watscn. The tormer (RA. 1690) speaks of those who ‘⁴ are prcud
and conceited...on obtaining the degree of bachelor,” but makes absolutely no
reference to any such feelings being excited by the student’s place on the list.
Though he was probably by far the best mathematician of his year, and tells us
that that subject was his main study‚ he was only placed twenty-fourth in the
list; but he makes nc complaint of the fact. On the other hand, Watson
(BA. 1756) has bitter complaints on his having been placed second instead
of first. The earliest reference that I have at present found to this subject is in
a letter of the Rev. H. Venn, Rector of Yelling, to his son. Speaking of his own
experience--he graduated BA. at Jesus in 1745-6-110 says ‘⁴ 1 was exceedingly
wretched for a time that Ι was not before Dr Conyers in honour ” z—R. Gonyers
was a college contemporary. 'l'hose who have studied College history know,
that till about the later period there is little or no connexion between the fact
of a man being high on the list, and his election to a feuowship. At Caius, the
earliest reference that 1 have found to “the Tripcs'’ in the awarding cf any
prize is in 1803.
