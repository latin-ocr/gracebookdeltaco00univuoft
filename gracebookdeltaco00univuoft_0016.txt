regularly appointed every year at the same time as the proctors;
and it is difficult to imagine examiners making their order of
precedence 0116 111 which “ merit '' was not recognised. There are
occasional references to them as far back as 1504 (Γ, p. 34). But
from 1545-ss the rule is that two “oppositores'' or “examinatores
questionistarum '' (commonly called “posers’') should be appointed
by grace. The list ,of these annual examiners is given in the
Appendix. Who it was who actually placed the men in their
order, is not quite plain. The phrase always used is that the place
occupied is that “quem ei pater assignavit ”3 the “father ’' being
one of the proctors, generally the senior proctor. But the grace
about the examiners (p. 360) shows that their duties were serious.
Probably the likeliest view is that the pater acted on their advice.
Stokys’ phrase is, “then shall the proctors appoint them their
seniority'' :—as is well known, the proctors had the right, down to
quite late times, to place some of their personal friends where they
pleased 111 1116 1161 (ν. Peacock, App. p. ix. ς and W. W. R. Ball,
Oriqin and History ῳ( the Mathematical Tripos).

Again, if we test the subsequent career of the graduates, Ι think
it will be found that on the whole those high in the list were the
more distinguished 111 after life. To give but one instance—as
illustration not as proof,—J 01111 Caius headed the Ordo in his year.
There is another indication telling in the same direction. Through-
out Grace Book E, and often in later years, only the names of the
first 20 or 30 are placed in order: the others are omitted, with the
statement that seniority is given to them “as they have it in their
Colleges '' (1627-8). And, where their names are given, those of
the same 0011636 816 frequently bracketed together. The first
20 or 30 names are evidently treated in a very different manner
from the 0111616. 11 must be remembered that the Ordo was quite
86 important for the M.A. as for the B.A.: in 1861, of the two, the
former is the more fully and regularly preserved. For the B.D.
the 681116 form is used, “The father shall 8661311 1116111 86 116 will
have them in seniority'’ <Peacock, App. xxxviii).

There can be little doubt, that the original and dominant idea
was simply that of assigning precedence. The higher degrees would
naturally precede the lower, as senior men would go before junior;
but, aa regards men of the same year, some other ground of decision
was called for. Whore men live together, and especially where they
take part in processions and compete for officea—as we may see in
