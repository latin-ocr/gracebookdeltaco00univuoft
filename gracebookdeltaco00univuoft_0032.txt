pp. 207, 8. The incident referred to at Leicester arose out of a
sermon by W. Hughes‚ Lady Margaret Preacher. He had
impugned the doctrine, De Demens-u Christi ad inferos (v.
Cooper, Annals, 11. 231).

p. 241 z gr. 2. The ordinance of King Edward IV for the founda-
tion of Chantry priests at Windsor is given in Grace Book A,
p. 160.

p. 256: gr. 7. Adam Holiday belongs to the class afterwards
known as “ten-year-men.” They were first specifically pro-
vided for in the Statutes of Edward VI: but the privilege of
obtaining the B.D. without previous graduation in Arts had
long been enjoyed by monks and friars, in accordance, it is
supposed, with Stat. Ant. 107.

p. 261 t gr. 2. The proctors' negative vote. The Statutes of 1572
greatly curtailed the power of the proctors, but I cannot
find in them any definite reference of this kind. Nor does
the long list of contemporary objectimw, published in Lamb’s
Documencs, seem to help us.

p. 266: gr. 5. Dr Peacock refers (p. 3) to this grace as “showing
that the authority of the Senate with respect to the ancient
statutes was considered at that time to be in no respect
diminished by the new system of laws'’: i.e. by the
Elizabethan Statutes just introduced.

p. 345 ε gr. 1. This grace seems, as Peacock suggests, an indication
of some recent irregularity, as it declares nothing but what
was already statutable. The consent of the caput had long
been necessary.

gr. 3. As to the variator or prevaricator, who corresponded,
at the MA. inception, to the Tripos at the B.A.‚ he “was
appointed for this duty at the commencement of the pre-
ceding year, having been sworn the last (though one of the
first called) on that occasion, and being consequently the
junior regent....So named from varying the question which
hc proposed, either by a play upon the words,” or otherwise.
Dr Pcacock gives an example, by James Duport, of one
of these exercises (Appondioe, p. xxvii.).

p. 347. The selection of the Earl of Essex for the Caput is a

unique instance of such an appointment.

p. 352: gr. l. 'rho casa of N. Bestney, of King's, denorves notice.
llo wan a mundationem scholar, and ἔθυον, but he was
