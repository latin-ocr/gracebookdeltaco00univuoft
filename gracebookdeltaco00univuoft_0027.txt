College and to the University, received the congratulatione of the

' University on his appointment to the Archbishopric of Oanterbury.

In 1586 a grace was passed (p. 405) for allowing Emmanuel
Oollege to take its place with the other Oolleges.

In the same year a grace was passed (p. 404) for prohibiting
booksellers from buying any book printed in London, which had been,
or should be, printed in Oxford or Cambridge.

In 1587 the chronic disputes between the University and the
Town seem to have risen to an unusual height, and graces are
passed to meet the “intollerabilis adversus Academiam et academicos
‘ingratitudo’' which the Townsmen displayed (pp. 415-9). For
further references to this, and the other permanent trouble of
medieval times—the Plague—see the Index,

It may be noted that the Awellations, or Appeals, of which
a list is given in the Index, were mostly from the decisions of the
Chancellor’s Oourt. By the Elizabethan Statutes, from three to
five delegates were appointed by the Caput and the proctors.
By ancient custom they had been appointed by the regente and
non-regente. The change was strongly opposed as an infringement
of the customary privileges (see Lamb’s Documem, p. 3723 and
Peacock's Observatiomr, p. 52).

This seems a convenient place for making some remarks upon
the former privileges of fellows of King's. As is well known, the
foundationers—as distinguished from other members—obtained the
B.A. and M.A. without any university examination. They oom-
peted for most of the classical scholarships and prizes, but till 1853
their names never appear in the Tripos lists. This state of things
had existed for very many years. But two points have, so far,
baffled enquiry: (l) By what right was this privilege obtained?
(2) From what period does it date? These questions puzzled
Peacock in 1841, and Mr Austen Leigh‚ some sixty years later,
when writing the history of his college, could throw no light upon
them. Peacock is inclined to believe that there was no legal or
statutable authority whatever for the privilege. In fact he quotes,
from Hare's Commoris, the Concessio of the University in 1448, in
which, as he says, there is included “in the most express terms,
the performance of every act which the University required for
admission to the degree of bachelor and master.'’ If so, the
conclusion would be that the usage gradually sprang up as an
