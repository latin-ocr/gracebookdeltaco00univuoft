p. 355: gr. 5. The ineiqnia doctoratus—the ring, etc—are fully
described by Peacock (Appendix, p. xl.).

p. 357: gr. 6. ste letter to Beza was doubtless one of thanks for
the recent gift of the famous codeae.

p. 360: gr. 6. We have an account of the actual procedure, which
led up to graduation, in the contemporary description by
Stokys (quoted by Peacock‚ App„ p. xxiv.). But this grace,
so far as I know, is the only evidence as to the statutable
requirements. It seems to point to a thorough system of
examination, as distinguished from the ordinary exercises.
Apposiers, vulgo “posers,'' were the appositores or examiners
annually appointed by grace. The “heade '’ referred to (line

p. 361. Τὴθ Ordo in this year is a good illustration of the distinction

mer

— last gr. The Septem viri must be the Caput, though I do not
remember to have seen the term elsewhere. The only
members who are ever mentioned are the five elected
members and the Vice-Chancellor. But by ancient custom
the “senior religious doctor ’' was included. By grace of
1547-8, the public orator took his place.
