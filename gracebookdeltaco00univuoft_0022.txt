fields‚ heard the bell ringing for a congregation in the Regent
House, and hurried to take his seat there. The supporters of Mary
were present in force and with cries of “ Traitor ’' dragged him from
the chair. Shortly after he was lodged in the Tower3 and when
liberated, ‘took refuge in Strasburg. The Duke of Northumberland
went to the Tower and the block, and Gardiner became Chaneellor

for the second time.

Most of these incidents are naturally not recorded in the Grace
Book, but reference to them is necessary in order to explain the
grace on p. 90: that “the letters to the Queen’s Grace should be
gratulatory, and not to impute the offenee of the sermon to the
whole University.’' How the office of Vice-Chancellor was filled
up, after Sandys’ expulsion‚ is not clear, and there seems to be
no official reference to the occurrence. In the list of the holders of
this office published by Dr Luard at the end of the Graduati (1884),
“ Dr Hawford of Christ's '' is assigned as Sandys' successor for the
rest of the academie year 1552-3. So competent a historian as
Dr Luard must have had some grounds for his statement, but I
have failed to ascertain them. Edward Hawford, afterwards
Master of Christ’s, was at that time senior proctor, and possibly
succeeded by some ancient custom¹ to the temporary duties of the
office. But, even 80, there is an anachronism, for Hawford was at
that time only M.A. ς he did not become a doctor till 15642.

With the accession of Mary, June 1553, the pendulum swung
back again. Stephen Gardiner was reappointed Chancellor: the florid

bearing on the ease in question.

Stephen Gardiner is certainly 1110 only known man of this name and College.
