INTRODUOTION xiii

This seems to show that the view—almost universally held in
Cambridge till recent times, and still widely prevalent—that the
recipient of the M.D. should have been well grounded in Arts
before specialising in Medicine, was already established in the days
of Dr Caius.

N ext as to the M.B. This certainly seems to have been intended
to represent a real degree, but one of a less literary kind than the
M.D. The words of the Elizabethan Statute of 1572 are as follows:
“Medicinae studiosus sex annos rem medicam discet, ejus lectionis
auditor assiduus: anatomias duas videat: bis respondeat, semel
opponat, antequam baccalaureus fiat.'’ That is to say, a previous
Arts degree was not required.

As a matter of fact this degree was by no means popular. At
the present day, as we all know, it is the usual portal through
which the M.D. is approached. In 1908, for instance, there were
46 of them as against 27 Μ.Ι). But throughout the whole 47 years
included in Grace Book Δ, Ι can only find three of these M.B.; of
whom two proceeded to M.D.

What seems to have usually taken the place of the M.B. was the
licence to practise. Of these there were two, one in medicine and
the other in surgery, which we may briefly iudicate by M.L. and C.L.
Here there seems some difficulty, which I have not succeeded in
completely clearing up.

The difficulty lies in reconciling the words of the statutes with
those of the Gracc Books, and with the customs which seem actually

· , - to have prevailed. The former seem to contemplate only three

classes3 namely M.D., M.B. (see the statute quoted above, headed
De studiosis Medic-ime), and the licence to practise surgery (headed
De studiosis ckivurqiae)¹. The last runs thus z “ Ohirurgiae studiosus
duas anatomias faciat: tres ad minimum curationes se fecisse probet,
antequam admittatur ad praxin chiru1·giae.'’ These statutes certainly
seem to me to contemplate only three divisione, namely two degreeS‚
and the licence to practise surgen-y. They imply that the “studiosus

¹ statuta Elizabethae‚ Nos. XV and XVI. 1 quote from the Elizabethan
statuta, because they seem clearer in their expression. It must be remembered
that their provisions not only prevailed down to recent times, but covered
almost the whole period with which we are concerned; for the tempor-ary
Edwardian Statutes, and those of 1559, are almost identical as regards the
matter in question. The Statuta antiqua are rather obscure on this point, ,but

they seem on the whole to make more distinction than the later statutes
between the M.B. and the M.L.
