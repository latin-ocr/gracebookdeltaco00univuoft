IN TRODUOTION .

HE volume known as Gracc Book Δ in the Registry is a large
and somewhat composite one. The part of it which is here
reproduced occupies the first 160 pages. It is, so far, continuouS,
carefully written, and in excellent condition. It records the graves
passed by the Senate during the 47 Academical years from 1542 to
1589 inclusive, together with the Ordo Senioricatis of the bachelors
and masters of each year. These graces belong to two classes. By
far the maj0rity of them are for the passing of the various degrees.
The ,remainden under the usual heading of “ Gratiae variae et nullam
formam concernentes,'' are concerned with the ordinary executive
business of the University. It is, of course, almost entirely amongst
these latter that references to any facts of historical or local interest
are to be found. In respect both of the handwriting, and of the
completeness of the Ordo lists, this volume offers a decided contrast
when compared with some of those which follow. It is written,
one would suppose, by a trained scribe¹: the Ordo is hardly ever
omitted, and, what is more, the lists embrace the name of every
man (with insignificant exceptions) who is mentioned in the pre-
ceding graees. In the volumes dealing with subsequent years there
are many omissions. Indeed during a long course of years only a
selection of names is given,—-the first 20 or 30 out of 250 or 300.
The rest of the volume is of a very miscellaneous character.
There are many blank pages. The Ordo list of three later years

(1603-4, 1604-5, 1607-8) is inserted quite out of place. There are
lists of officers and appointments straggling over many years, down

even to 1655. Copies of licences, deeds, leases, testimonials, miscel· '

laneous appointments, and other official documents are inserted.
There is a MS. Index of Contents, compiled, or at least revised,
by Mr J oseph Romilly, registrary.

¹ The registraries for this period are John Mero (1543-58), and Matthew
Stokys· (1558—91).
