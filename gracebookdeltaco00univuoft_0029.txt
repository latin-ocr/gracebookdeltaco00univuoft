equivalent expression, in general use for these degrees from 1528-9.
Before that date, the King’s B.A. degrees are seldom mentioned in
the list of graces, which, of course, looks as if there was something
exceptional about them. The M.A. degrees, on the other hand,
generally are recorded 3 and, where recorded, it is significant that the
expression used is exactly the same as for members of other collegas.
There are many of these between 1510 and 1528, in which it is
expressly stated that the candidate had attended the ordinary
lectures and performed the usual responsione. The B.A. degree,
however, is not always omitted, and where it is recorded the
customary expression is used. Take the case of S. Simonds, B.A.
1508-9, a foundationer and fellow. It is plainly stated that he had
kept the usual oppositione and responsions, etc. His grace is in
every way identical with those referring to other collegas.

It seems therefore that the custom of claiming exemptions began
to prevail about 1510-25, but that examination was not avoided till
much later.

As foot-notes are not introduced into the text of these volumen,
the following miscellaneous comments may be found convenient : ’

p. 2: grace 7. The exhibitio enjoyed by G. Sutton from the King‚
indicates presumably that he was a scholar of King's Hall,
the ancient foundation soon afterwards absorbed into Trinity
College.

p. 14 : gr. l. The power to confer the M.A. without previous B.A.

⁴ was an ancient privilege of which the University was after-

wards deprived by the rigid Elizabethan Statutes of 1572.
See also pp. 24, 33, etc.

p. 28 : gr. 7. References to the use of the bell of St Benedict's (for

congregations‚ etc.) by the University‚ will be found in Gracc
Book B, pp. 184, 194, etc.

gr. 9. Gilbert Ronsbury was the founder of one of the
“chests '’ (see Commem. qs Benefactors, printed in the camb.
Trans. Pur-itan Per-iod, 11. 430). Why he is thus singled out
is not easy to see. His name is not mentioned in the index
to J. W. Olark's Endowments.

p. 29 ι gr. 1. Oleaning of the streets. For more on this subject see

Cooper, Δηπαῑε, 1. 4095 where the “Act concerning the
Paving of Cambridge,'' is printed.
