every regiment, college, and school,—there must be some means of
deciding at once as to “seniority,'' if we are to avoid friction and
dispute. The results of examination were probably used, not so
much as an end in themselves, as a convenient means of assigning
this precedence.

We cannot quit this particular topic without making a passing
reference to the only other University examination which can be
put in comparison with the Cambridge one. It is that which
prevailed at the old University of Louvain. In some respects this
latter stood distinctly higher. It appears to have been, from the
first, universally recognised as an “order of merit,’' a position to
which, as we have seen, our Tripos only slowly and gradually
attained. Moreover it was considerably the older of the two, the

Louvain lists being almost continuous from 14281. But this
examination came to an end, with the old University, in 1793; so
that in respect of duration it must take the second place.

As to the degrees recorded in our Gracc Book, they are, with
two exceptions, those with which we are familiar at the present
day. These exceptions refer to Canon Law and to Grammar.
Degrees in the former were abolished, together with the academie
study of the Faculty‚ by the Royal Injunctions of 1535 5 as a result
of Henry VIII's dispute with the Pope. They were revived—
presumably in accordance with the injunctions of the Queen —during
the brief Marian reaction; three such degrees will be found on
pages 105, 114, 118. Ι11 the case of Hugh Griffyn (p. 114) it is
expressly stated, that in the absence of any doctor of the Canon
Law he was to be presented by a doctor of the Givil Law. As
a reference to the earlier Grace Books will show, Canon Inw degrees
were a favourite resource with the more ambitious ecclesiastics, and
especially with the Monks. At the suppression of the monasteries,
of course, the supply of the latter class of students came at once to

an end. As to the degrees in Grammar, there was apparently no
legislation: they seem to have simply fallen into disuse in com-

parison with the more popular Arts degrees. I find only two such
recorded, namely on pages 1 and 48. In the previous Grace Book
there were 37.

As regards some of the other degrees very little need be said.
