letter of congratulation sent to him by the University is printed in
Lamb's Documents (p. 167). We soon find such greces as this
(p. 100) that the Vice-Chancellor and certain other doctors
“ Oxoniam proficiscantur ad propugnandam veram et catholicam
fidem et ·’ contrariam doctrinam impugnandam '': their mission, as
will be remembered, was to confute Granmer‚ Ridley and Latimer‚
before their martyrdom. Degrees in Canon Law, as already pointed
out, begin to be revived. In February, 1556-7, took place the
strange procedure of the exhumation of the bodies of Bucer and
Fagius, their condemnation for heresy, and their public burning in
the Market-place. After Stephen Gardiner's death in 1553, a still
more significant step was taken in the appointment of Cardinal Pole
as Chancellor.

Very many of the changes which mark this period, of course, are
not recorded in the Gracc Book: for instance those which concern
the mastership of the Oolleges. Others are likely to escape notice;
thus on looking closely at the names of the holders of various cilices,
we may observe the total absence of many which frequently recur
in the preceding and succeeding reigns. Of these perhaps Matthew
Parker was the most distinguished, but there were many other
exiles from Cambridge besides the future Archbishop.

Then came the final change, so far as we are concerned, when
Queen Mary, and her cousin the Cardinal Chancellor, died about
the same time, November, 1558. The new Chancellor was Sir
William Oecil, an appointment of the type which has been adhered
to ever since in Cambridge, that, namely, of the great lay nobleman.
The Vico-Chaucellor, Edmund Cosyn, Master of St Catharine'S,
almost immediately resigned that office, together with thc master·
ship, and retired into private life as a fellow-commoner at Caius.
Soon after, the reformed order is publicly displayed by a grace
(p. 139), for cancelling the decree about Bucer and Fagius. The
deceased divines are duly restored to their degrees and titles of
honour.

*So much for the influence of public events. The principal in-
cidents of purely academie interest seem to be the following :—
In May, 1544, the Statute enjoining Matriculation was passed

(v. p. 19). Oarelessly and imperfectly as it was sometimes carried
out, it marks the first attempt of the University to keep a record of

all its enrolled members. In the same year the rectory of Burwell
