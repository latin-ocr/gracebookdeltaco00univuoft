The constitution of the University, for executive purposeS, had
also become nearly fixed by law and by custom. The chief executive
officer, the Vice-Chancellor, was¹ almost invariably chosen from
amongst the Heads of Houses, as he is to this day. The 011611116Πο1-
was always some nobleman of high dignity. In early days he had
011611 116611 611 ecclesiastic. The last of this type was Stephon
Gardiner, who was reappointed during the brief Μελ-1611 reaction.
His successor, Oardinal Reginald Pole, son of Margaret, Lady
Salisbury, and, through her, 01 royal extraction, scarcely belongs to
the mere ecclesiastical order. With the election of Sir W. Cecil,
Lord Burghley, in 1559, the modern usage becomes firmly estab—
lished.

'I'he executive body, so far as we can call it so, in the University,
was the Caput. The first reference to this body in the Grace
Books, so far as I can ascertain, is in 1526. The first reference
to the name by which it was always afterwards known seems to be
in 1547-8, when we read “in capite ut vocant '' (p. 53). It consisted
of the Vice-Ohancellor (in absence of the Ohancellor) ; three doctore
in Divinity, Law, and Medicine respectively3 a non-regent; and a
regent. The last of these, being an M.A. of not more than three
or four years standing& represented the junior element. The non-
regent member was an M.A. of senior standing, or, very frequently
a B.D.⁸ This executive body was only superseded by the present
“Oouncil of the Senate'' during the reforms introduced in 1860.

In criticising such a scheme as this of the Caput, we have
obviously to distinguish between the rules and the way in which
they were worked. In itself the arrangement does not seem a bad
one. In two respects, indeed, it seems sounder than the present
arrangement: first in respect that the check against partiality had
in view, not colleges or University status, but saculties. Each of

the three faculties was duly represented. Again a youthful member ,

¹ There are only three or four exceptione during our period; the last ot
these was Dr J. Oopcot (1586-7), who, though he afterwards became Master of
eorpus, was not Master at the time of his Vico-Chanoellorship.

² The period of regency was extended from three years to five by the
Elizabethan Statutes of 1572.

⁸ By grace of 1547-8 (p. 63) the orator was appointed to take the place on

the Caput· formerly held by a ‘⁴ religious doctor.’' But 1 cannot find his name
recorded as such.
