abuse 3 probably suggested, rather than authorised, by certain
undoubted privileges granted to the College.

If we consider only the evidence afforded by our Gracc Book,
there would not, I think, be much doubt on this point. There is
one phrase almost invariably employed: “determinatores collegii
Regalis quibus nec petita nec concessa est gratia.’' Surely what
this implies is not that the King's man obtained his degree without
exercisoe or examination, but that, after having performed these
conditions he could demand as a right what members of other
colleges had to ask for as a favour. For him no “supplicat '' was
sent in. Of course this brings us no nearer to the origin or
justification of the privilege, but it supports the view that tho
evasion of all examination was a slowly developed abuse·

Two points seem to have escaped notice in the discussion. As
just stated, King's men did not appear in the Tripos lists. But the
Mathematical Tripos is lineally identical with the ancient Ordo.
And in this Ordo their names do almost invariably appear. They
occupy, like others, all places in the list, from the top downwards.
In the last year of our Gracc Book, 1588-9‚ every King’s man is duly
placed. On what principle could their places have been assigned, if
they had refused examination'l

Again‚ notice the curious expression which occurs once or twice
(pp. 70, 72) that certain King’s men did not pay anything “pro
exoneratione conscientiae.'' sse phrase is a technical one. In a long
list (Stokys’ Book, in the Registry: quoted by Peacock, App. p. κν.)
of 15 distinct fees paid by questionists on proceeding to a degree,
two are as follows: “pro gratia petenda ”3 “pro exoneratione
conscientiae '' (the latter being supposed to cover any accidental
neglect of form in proceeding to the degree). That the King’s men
should not pay fees for a grace which they did not ask for, is
natural3 and there was no need to mention the fact. But what.
can be the object of specifying that, on these occasions, the
“conscience ’' payment had been omitted, unless it were that this
belonged to the ordinary degree sees to which they were, like other
studente, subject?

As to the other question, namely, ut what date did this peculim·
privilege begin to be claimed, Ι think that a study of the Gracc
Book will give some help. As already intimated, throughout Δ the
BA. and MA. are given to King’s men “sine gratia petita aut
mammas And, if we consult B we there flnd the same, or an
