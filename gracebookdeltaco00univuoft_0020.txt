medicinae '' will naturally become M.B., whilst the “studiosus
chirurgiae ” will obtain, not a degree, but only a licence.

When, however, we turn to the Grace Books, we find sour
divisions: namely the above three, and the “licence to practise
medicine ²' as distinguished from the M.B. The wording of the
graces in the two cases is quite distinct; in the form for M.B. the

candidate is admitted “ad intrandum,'' in that for ML “ad
practicandum.'' And the headings in the Grace Book mark the

same distinction. Thus on p. 291, Peter Oottie, admitted ad
practicwndum, stands under the heading “ Praeticans in Medicina ” ς
whilst, immediately after him, John Bishope, admitted ad intrandum,
is duly described as “ Bacchalaureus in Medicina.” ’

When we look to what was done, as distinguished from what
was said, it certainly seems to support the view that the M.L. or
licence to practise Medicine, was regarded as the equivalent of the
M.B. It was much the more popular qualification‚ for we find 41 of
them as against the three who took M.B. And in popular estima-
tion no difference seems to have been recognised. The most striking
instance in point is afforded by the famous William Butler of Clare
Hau, whose medical reputation extended far and wide. He was
generally called ‘⁴ Dr Butler‚” but his only qualification was this
licence. When application was made by the Chancellor to that
jealous body, the College of PhysicianS, that Butler might be
allowed to practise occasionally on his visits to London, his title
was recognised and permission was granted. The Chaucellor terms
him ‘⁴ M1· Butler, Professor of Physic”: the College terms him
“ Dr Butler '' (0. Goodall, Proceedinqe ayainst Empirics, p. 336).

Similarly, when we look at the career of the candidates, we find
a broad differ-enee between the holders of the medical and surgical
licences. The former are much the more amlemie. Of the 41 no
less than 25 had graduated in arts, and of these 12 subsequently
pmoetxled to the M.D. Of those who held the surgical licenoos,
17 in number, only three appear to have taken an Arts degree.

the statute, to koop his act and opponeneieS, though in one of the
three casm (W. Kenyngliam, p. 118) there is no mention of anything
more than examination. In the latter case he underwent an ex-
amination by two docum npocifled in the grace. Tho usual form
