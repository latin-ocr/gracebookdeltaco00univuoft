p. 122: gr. 3. The visitation referred to is that of Cardinal Pole.
We may suppose that the last grace on the page indicates
that it was the Cardinal’s intention that the persons here
mentioned should draw up a more perfect code for his approval
(lamb, Documenta, p. xxxvii.>. For a line in the original,
which has unfortunately been dropped out here, see the
Errata.

—— gr. 5. The reference to the Statutes of Clare Hall may
perhaps be explained by the direction of Oardinal Pole to
the Vice-Ohancellor to “visit in our name especially Clare
Hall.'’ The date would suit.

p. 130. The occurrence of three Vice-Chancellors in a few months
is thus accounted for. Dr Brassey was appointed in October,
1558, but died a month later, November 8, when Edm.
Oosyn, Master of St catharine's, succeeded. Queen Elizabeth
came to the throne November 17, 1558; on which Cosyn,
who was a strong Romanist, retired, and was followed by
John Pory or Poore.

p. 132: gr. 4. The visitors referred to are those who drew up the
first set of statutes imposed by Elizabeth.

p. 139: gr. 3. John Mere, registrar of the University 1543 to 1558.
Besides other gifts he left two houses to the University
(v. Oooper, Aah. Cant. 1. 174). The deed is printed in
J. W. Clark’s Endowments.

p. 140: gr. 4. As to the colla-cors, “themselves likewise determinem
appointed by the proctors, who distributed the other deter-
miners into the different schools, and also assigned the ouler
of their disputations,'' see Peacock (App. xiv.). According
to Mr Rashdall, the “collectores bacallaureorum ” survived,
nominally, till quite recent times in Oxford (Universicies,
1. 444 n).

p. 157: gr. 2. William Day, of King's College‚ had just been
appointed provost of Eton.

p. 160: gr. 8. The Liber niyer, under the title of the “ Black Book
of the Vice-Ohancellor ’' is in the Registry. It is a collection
of deeds, statuteS, etc.

p. 204: gr. l. Sir W. Chester, MP. for London, Lord Mayor in
1560, was formerly of Peterhouse. For more about him,
see Oooper, Am. Came. 1. 311. Probably he is the Mr Chester
referred to on p. 89, as giving 210.
