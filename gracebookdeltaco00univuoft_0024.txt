of this volume contains the Subsequent references to this acquisition.
About the same time an event which, if it had been successfully
carried out, would have been of terrible significance to the
University, was only just averfed. What was contemplated by
the courtiers was nothing less than the spoliation of all the Colleges

appointed which gave a full account of the various revenues. Thanks
to Parker, the King was constrained to admit, after perusing it, that
“he thought he had not iu his 18811118 80 many parsons 80 honestly

menta, p. 60).

The first event of importance in the reign of Edward VI was
the promulgation by the King of a set of new Statutes, April 8,
1549. In the same year, there was a Royal Visitation of the
University of which a full account is given in Lamb’s Documenta.

One of the first acts of Queen Mary was to restore the ancient
statutas. A new University cross was purchased, all the Oolleges
contributing 10 1118 expense. A chaplain, who was ‘⁴ custos crucis,'
was duly appointed (p. 100), 80 88 to restore the old ceremonial. A
few years afterwards this cross in its turn was sold, and the proceeds
handed back to the various contributing Oolleges (pp. 191, 198).
In August, 1554, the University sent a letter of congratulation to
King Philip on his arrival in England. It seems probable that the
graec on p. 100 refers to this3 as Lord Paget had just been elected,
for the second time, to the office of High Steward. The grace
(9. 122) about the Exequies of Henry VII marks the change from
the Edwardian riqime. In December, 1556, there was again 11
visitation of the University, this time under the direction of
cardinal Pole. It is referred to in the third grace on p. 122.
