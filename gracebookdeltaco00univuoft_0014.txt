was always secured, for the regent would very seldom be more than
25 years oldl. The principa] complaint urged in later days seems
to have applied to an abuse of the method of election by which, in
practice, only those members were elected who were proposed by the
Vice-Chancellor: in other words, the Heads had the entire control
(v. Mulli‘nyer’s History, 11. 223).

Perhaps the word Caput is answerable for the belief which
seems to have been held by some persons, that that body consisted
of a “lot of old Heads.’' In both respects such an opinion is
singularly wide of the mark. The present Council must have five
Heads3 four elected, and the Vice-Chancellor3 the old Caput need
not have had one, for even the Vice-Ohancellor was not always of
that order. As a matter of fact it sometimes included only one.
In regard 1ο 1116 age of the members the reader is referred to the
note above.

Another striking instance of the continuity of the present and
the past is 1ο be found in the famous lists, known in old days as the
Ordo oenioritatis, and in later days as the Mathematical Tripos,
which are recorded almost without omission from 1491 down to
1909. This particular statement will need some explanation, as
many persons will be inclined 1ο 6161111 for the class list of 1910 611
identity with that of 1909, whilst others will question our right to
identify the ancient Ordo with the recent familiar Tripos. The
answer is that one 6161116111, 611(1 0116 6161116111 only, can be traced
right through the whole series down to last year. This was the
placing of the men in individua} order3 and this 6161116111, 66 we all
know, was abolished by recent regulation. Till then no definite
breach of continuity can be detected through the lapse of more than
four centuries. Of course if we bring into juxtaposition two lists, a
century or two apart, for the purpose of comparison, we shall find
the differences between them very great, but if we examine them
